here filter is saying `not true` (`!` means `NOT`) that value in column `fruit` is in  (using `%in%` operator) in the collections `c("apples","pears","plums")`
```{r}
# hint2: filter() and collections
data.frame(number = 1:3, fruit = c("banana","kiwi","pears")) %>% 
  filter(!(fruit %in% c("apples","pears","plums"))) 
```
