things that might go wrong:

- are your variable names consistent? if you are putting something in a new variable, are you later using that new variable?

```{r}
fruit <- "banana"
fruit_large <- toupper(fruit)
print(fruit)
# oh no! banana is still small?
```
- if you changed column names first, remember to use those new column names in the code that follows
```{r}
#note: this code is made up and won't work
fruits_df <- read.csv("data/fruits.csv") 
# say original file has columns "named", "hue", "measurement"
names(fruits_df) <- c("name", "color", "size")
fruits_df_yellow <- subset(fruits_df, hue = "yellow")  #
```
