Can you write a regular expression which capture all places where time is mentioned in my_sentence? For simplicity assume time is always pm

```{r}
my_sentence <- "Hello, how are you today? I am looking forward to fun with NLP. What time does it start? It starts at 1:30pm, do you want to do lunch at 12pm?"

times_no_minutes <- str_extract_all(my_sentence, "\\d+pm")
print(times_no_minutes)

times_minutes <- str_extract_all(my_sentence, "\\d+:\\d+pm")
print(times_minutes)

times_both <- str_extract_all(my_sentence, "\\d+:\\d+pm|\\d+pm")
print(times_both)
```
