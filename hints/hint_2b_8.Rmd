Oh no, but what if a room name has some other letters just before it or just after? like BB.123A?

```{r}
tricky_rooms_string <- " BSSFSST.123AA BBBBBBB.123AA BB.123A B.123A B.123AA B.123AA "
# one is correct. which one? why?

regex_previous <- "[BFST]{1}\\.\\d{1,3}[TARP]{1}"
tricky_rooms <- str_extract_all(tricky_rooms_string, regex_previous)
print(tricky_rooms)
# it looks like some invalid names sneaked in


regex_fancier <- "(?<=\\s)[BFST]{1}\\.\\d{1,3}[TARP]{1}(?=\\s)"
# i.e. say "has to have a string before, and after"
tricky_rooms_fancy <- str_extract_all(tricky_rooms_string, regex_fancier)

print(tricky_rooms_fancy)

# you could go firther and say 'has to have a string or end at the beginning, and string or end at the end'
# but that's not for today
```
