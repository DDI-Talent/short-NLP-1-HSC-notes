```{r}
# NOTE: you might be asked for something in the "Console" area of RStudio. Just say Yes.

sentimental_words <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment == "anger")

sentimental_words
```
ok, but what's in afinn?
```{r}
# NOTE: you might be asked for something in the "Console" area of RStudio. Just say Yes.

affin_words <- get_sentiments("afinn")
affin_words

affin_words_really_high <- affin_words %>% 
  filter(value < 4 )

affin_words_really_high
```

AMAZING! so we have positive words. I'm guessing there will not be very many of those in Covid-related tweets:

```{r}
corona_great_mood <-corona_words %>%s
  inner_join(affin_words_really_high) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

corona_great_mood
```
