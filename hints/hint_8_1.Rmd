Yes, some everyday words sneaked in, and got interpreted as surnames (e.g. Germany, Money) because it is possible to be called Jim Germany (a Canadian footballer).

But it is rather unlikely that a word Germany refers to a surname, rather it's a country. How could we tell that they occur as a surname - regex to look around and see if there is a name before or a title?
